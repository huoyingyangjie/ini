# ini
## Backgroud
I believe that many scenarios still need "ini" configuration files, So I prepared this.
## Support
* C and C++
* global and local
* use "//" as comments at the beginning of line 
* multiple sections
* section name can carry space on both sides
## How to use

## Notes
* don't use the same key at section
